class Service(db.Model):
    """
    Defines the Service model, representing a service record in the database.

    This class is designed to store and manage information related to a service.
    Each service represents an entry associated with a driver, a user, a vehicle,
    a contract, along with various locations and status indicators. It serves as
    a blueprint for mapping the corresponding table in the database and includes
    methods for serializing data into a dictionary format.

    Attributes:
        id (int): The primary identifier for the service.
        driver_id (int): Foreign key referencing the associated driver's ID.
        user_id (int): Foreign key identifying the associated user's ID.
        vehicle_id (int): Foreign key referring to the associated vehicle's ID.
        contract_id (int): Foreign key linking the associated contract's ID.
        parking_location (int): Foreign key indicating the parking location's ID.
        pickup_location (int): Foreign key denoting the pickup location's ID.
        keys_location (int): Foreign key specifying the keys location's ID.
        is_finished (bool): Indicates whether the service is complete.
        created_at (datetime): Timestamp for when the service was created.
        is_deleted (bool): Denotes whether the service is marked as deleted.
